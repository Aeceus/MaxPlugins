A few max plugins to make my life easier at work

Bridge Edges

A tool used to recreate the core function of the bridge edges tool so that it can be placed inside the quad menu rather than having to access
the command panel. This means you can have less UI and more screen space for a more involved modelling experience.

Remove plus

A simple tool that by default removes vertices with edges when used, another tool to remove the command panel and not use two buttons to
remove edges.

MeshTidy

A tool that cleans various nodes from meshes and readies them for export in a Y-up environment without adding uneccessary transforms or having
nulls that have incorrect local coordinates. Very useful for a max to cinema workflow.

Screw Creator

Screw creator allows the user to place a screw, nut or bolt on a given surface making it much easier to orient the mesh upon creation and stops
the user from having to import the correct mesh each time. It also provides a visual UI making it easier to select the correct screw. It grabs 
the screws themselves from another file in the users startup scripts directory that are added as base objects.
